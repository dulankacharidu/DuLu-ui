Please solve any problems caused by your own configuration errors. Issues are only used to solve the bugs of the panel itself.

If you are sure that there is a bug in the functional implementation of the panel, please provide as much more precise description information, reproduction methods, reproduction results, etc. as possible, rather than just a hasty sentence, which will not help solve the problem.
